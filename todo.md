what is still left to do:
- [x] pass all the identifiers through the g function or handle them specially
- [x] when the input of a cell starts with "=" treat is as a formula
- [x] allow functions / formulas that return strings (currently only "NUMBER"-cells are supported by the g function)
- [x] compute/parse all formulas before rendering
- [ ] better error handling
- [ ] blurry the lines between "STRING", "NUMBER", and "EMPTY" cells (maybe even completely remove them or just make it so that they can switch freely from one to the other)
- [ ] maybe refactor Spreadsheet.js a bit
- [ ] write standard library for the formulas
- [ ] add more keyboard shortcuts (like backspace for a selection / single cell for example)
- [ ] add transpiling for range operator (maybe just use an array for this?)
- [ ] run the parsing in a webworker, this way the main thread does not crash when the parser is stuck in an infinite loop (and the main thread can potentially time out the worker after x milliseconds)
