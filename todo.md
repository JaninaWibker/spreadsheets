what is still left to do:
- [x] pass all the identifiers through the g function or handle them specially
- [x] when the input of a cell starts with "=" treat is as a formula
- [x] allow functions / formulas that return strings (currently only "NUMBER"-cells are supported by the g function)
- [x] compute/parse all formulas before rendering
- [x] maybe refactor Spreadsheet.js a bit
- [x] write standard library for the formulas
- [x] add transpiling for range operator (maybe just use an array for this?)
- [x] create basic file format
- [ ] better error handling
- [ ] blurry the lines between "STRING", "NUMBER", and "EMPTY" cells (maybe even completely remove them or just make it so that they can switch freely from one to the other)
- [ ] add more keyboard shortcuts (like backspace for a selection / single cell for example)
- [ ] manage cell focus better
- [ ] improve error reporting inside transpiled (formula) code
- [ ] add boolean value cell type and maybe date type (this could be a subtype of string to be honest. This means that instead of `number | string` being accepted everywhere it would need to be `number | string | boolean | Date`)
- [ ] add background and text colors (save via style object?)
- [ ] create a rightclick menu
